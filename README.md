# Abstract
Test point insertion (TPI) is a widely used technique for testability enhancement, especially for logic built-in self-test (LBIST) due to its relatively low fault coverage. In this paper, we propose a novel TPI approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), named \emph{DeepTPI}. Unlike previous learning-based solutions that formulate the TPI task as a supervised-learning problem, we train a novel DRL agent with the Deep Q-learning algorithm. Specifically, we model circuits as directed graphs and embed a graph neural networks (GNNs) into the value network to predict the action value. Meanwhile, we leverage the general node embedding from a pre-trained model as a partial node feature and design a dedicated testability-aware attention mechanism for the value network. The ablation studies prove that our agent can learn a better policy with the above two methods. Experimental results on circuits with different scale show that DeepTPI significantly improves test coverage compared to existing solutions.

<!-- ## TPI for LBIST
The pseudo-random test patterns in LBIST are generated on chip to verify whether the correctness of circuit response. However, there are still some random pattern resistant (RPR) faults, whose patterns are very difficultly excited by random pattern generator. In order to detect these RPR faults and improve test coverage (TC), DFT engineers have to insert some extra gates into the netlist following the test point insertion (TPI) methods. These extra gates allow directly modifying the value somewhere inside the circuit and are named as control points (CP).
